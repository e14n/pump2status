# pump2status

This is a bridge that lets you find the pump.io accounts of people you
know on the OStatus network and automatically follow them.

You can also automatically push your pump.io activities to your
StatusNet site. So that's good, too.

The canonical site is at https://pump2status.net/ . If you set up your
own, it will only have data for people who signed up with your server,
so it's not going to be as useful. But the code's here if you want to
study it or set up another friend-finder bridge like this.
